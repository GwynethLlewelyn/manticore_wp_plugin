WordPress Manticore Search Plugin
========

This is fork of [Luc Michalski's Manticore Search Plugin](https://github.com/lucmichalski/manticore-wordpress/archive/master.zip), which in turn is a fork of [Ivinco's WordPress Sphinx Search plugin](https://github.com/Ivinco/WordPress-Sphinx-Search-plugin). Luc does not offer the plugin separately from his complete application [Wordpress demo with 18k movies indexed by manticore search plugin. (Beta)](https://github.com/lucmichalski/manticore-wordpress), thus my fork.

Manticore Search Plugin allows to use Manticore Search Server power to enable ultra-fast and feature-rich search on WordPress-based websites. [Manticore Search](https://manticoresearch.com/), in turn, is a fork of the legendary [Sphinx Search](https://sphinxsearch.com/) (a superfast full-text search engine), which is being actively developed. It's not a 100% drop-in replacement for Sphinx, but close. There is also a [WordPress Sphinx Search Plugin by Ivinco](http://www.ivinco.com/software/wordpress-sphinx-search/) which hasn't been updated in several years and will probably only work on older, incompatible versions of Sphinx (and not on Manticore at all). 

Description
--------
WordPress Manticore Search Plugin allows to use Manticore Search Server power to enable ultra-fast and feature-rich search on WordPress-based websites. It is especially useful if your WordPress site becomes very large.

Search results are more relevant and you can search in posts, pages and comments using flexible search syntax, quickly sort the results by freshness, relevance or in both modes. This plugin comes with sidebar widgets to display the most recent searches, top and related search terms.

This plugin replaces WordPress’s built-in search functionality.

### Features

The original Ivinco plugin highlights the following features:

 *   Sort search results by Relevance, Freshness or in both modes
 *   Related searches widget is a great SEO tool for finding related search terms
 *   Top searches widget is another SEO tool which displays top search terms when no related search terms found
 *   Latest searches widget is a SEO tool which is used to display latest search terms of those people are doing right now
 *   Widget settings have plenty of options to control widget behavior and quality of widget content
 *   Search through posts, pages and comments content
 *   Search Management Tools is a set of tools for managing search terms
 *   Search Statistics Tool is an analytic tool which can help you analyze search trends of your blog

More key features are described on the Ivinco page for the [WordPress Sphinx Search Plugin](https://www.ivinco.com/software/wordpress-sphinx-search/).

### Installation

This fork of a fork pretty much follows the plugin installation instructions shown on the [WordPress Sphinx Search plugin tutorial](https://www.ivinco.com/software/wordpress-sphinx-search-tutorial/) page.

### Support

This original plugin was developed by [Ivinco](https://ivinco.com), which offers [commercial support](https://www.ivinco.com/software/wordpress-sphinx-search/#commercial_support). Luc Michalski's own fork and adaptation to Manticore may or not may have any sort of support. _My_ own fork, however, does not offer any kind support whatsoever. It's publicly and freely distributed 'as-is' or YGWYS — 'you get what you see' — and I cannot guarantee _anything_, not even that this will work on _your_ WordPress installation, or that it will work in the foreseeable future.
